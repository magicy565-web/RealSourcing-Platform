# RealSourcing Explainer Video v3.0: The "I Get It" Script

**To:** RealSourcing Founder

**From:** Manus AI (as your in-house Creative Director)

**Subject:** Final Script for the "Real Player" Explainer Video

---

This is it. We're throwing away the corporate gloss and the abstract concepts. This script is built entirely on the raw, honest truth you provided. It's designed to make a seasoned dropshipper watch, nod, and say, **"Finally, someone gets it."**

Our entire production strategy is based on one principle: **Authenticity**. This video should feel like it was made by a successful 7-figure DTC founder sharing their secrets in a private Discord, not by a marketing agency.

### Production Philosophy

*   **Pacing & Style:** Fast-paced, rhythmic editing. Think a mix of a high-quality YouTube explainer (like Johnny Harris) and a genuine TikTok "day in the life of an entrepreneur" video.
*   **Visuals:** Heavy use of screen recordings (Shopify, TikTok, Alibaba, email inboxes), stock footage that looks *real* (not cheesy), and simple, clean text animations. No actors, no corporate B-roll.
*   **Narrator's Tone:** Not a professional voice actor. It should be you, or someone who sounds like a real entrepreneur. Slightly informal, confident, empathetic, maybe a little bit tired of the old way of doing things.

## 🎬 Video Script: "The Part They Don't Teach You"

**Target Audience:** Experienced Dropshippers & DTC Brand Owners

**Core Message:** Stop being a part-time sourcing agent. We handle the part you hate, so you can focus on the part you love.

**Estimated Length:** 90 Seconds | **Music:** Starts with upbeat, motivational "hustle" lo-fi, transitions to a tense, frustrating drone, and resolves into a clear, hopeful, and empowering electronic track.

### **Part 1: The Dream vs. The Grind (0-25s)**

| Time (s) | Visual (What We See) | Narration (What We Hear) | On-Screen Text (Keywords) |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 00-08 | **Fast-paced montage of the "Dropshipping Dream":**<br>1. Screen recording of a Shopify sales notification popping up (`Cha-ching!`).<br>2. A viral TikTok video of a quirky product getting millions of views.<br>3. A YouTube thumbnail: "How I Made $100k in 30 Days".<br>4. A cursor highlighting a massive ad spend in a Facebook Ads Manager dashboard. | (Music: Upbeat, motivational lo-fi hip-hop)<br><br>**"Dropshipping as a business model has been around for years. There are endless courses, tutorials... teaching you how to build a website..."** | `BUILD A WEBSITE`<br>`GO VIRAL`<br>`PICK A NICHE` |
| 08-15 | The montage continues, but the vibe shifts slightly.<br>1. A mouse frantically clicking through dozens of sourcing agent websites.<br>2. A shot of a complex flowchart trying to map out a supply chain.<br>3. A close-up of a YouTube video titled "How to Find a RELIABLE Supplier". | **"...how to make viral videos, how to pick a niche market. You can find tons of videos like that."** | `Find Suppliers`<br>`Avoid Scams`<br>`Negotiate Price` |
| 15-25 | **The music abruptly cuts.** The screen shows a single, stark shot: A person (seen from behind) sitting at a desk at 2 AM. The only light is from their laptop, which displays a massive, confusing spreadsheet of potential suppliers. Empty coffee mugs are on the desk. | (Sound: Silence, then a single, tired sigh)<br><br>**"But if you're a *real* player in this game, you know there's one part you can never escape: dealing with the manufacturers."**<br><br>**"And you realize this one thing... is eating up all the time you should be spending on creativity and marketing."** | (Text appears slowly, letter by letter)<br>**THE PART NO ONE TEACHES YOU** |


### **Part 2: The Sourcing Nightmare (25-55s)**

| Time (s) | Visual (What We See) | Narration (What We Hear) | On-Screen Text (Keywords) |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 25-35 | **Music shifts to a tense, frustrating drone.**<br>1. Screen recording of an email inbox. An email sent to `sales@factory-xyz.com` is marked `Sent 3 days ago`, with no reply.<br>2. A shot of a WhatsApp chat. The factory contact's status is `last seen yesterday`. The message below it has only one blue tick.<br>3. A calculator app on a phone screen. The user is trying to calculate landed costs, but keeps deleting the numbers, looking frustrated. | **"Dealing with these factories is always frustrating. Not only is the response time slow, but the final terms aren't always what you hoped for."** | `NO REPLY`<br>`SLOW RESPONSE`<br>`HIDDEN COSTS` |
| 35-45 | **The pace quickens, showing the desperate search.**<br>1. Screen recording: A user sees a viral product on TikTok. They frantically copy the product name and paste it into Google, Alibaba, and 1688 search bars. The results are a confusing mess of identical-looking products with wildly different prices.<br>2. A cursor hovers over an Alibaba listing. The supplier is a "Gold Supplier" for 10 years, but the product photos look stolen. | **"When you find that hidden gem on TikTok or Google, you have no idea how to get a real price from the original manufacturer."** | `WHO IS THE REAL FACTORY?`<br>`Is this price real?` |
| 45-55 | **The visuals show the flawed "solution".**<br>1. A slickly designed sourcing agent website homepage with promises like "We Find, You Sell!".<br>2. A screen recording of a conversation with an agent. The agent sends a price: "Best price is $5.80, friend." The user types back, "Can you get it for $5.20?" The agent replies, "Sorry friend, this is lowest price."<br>3. A blurry, low-quality photo of a product sample, clearly taken by an agent in a poorly lit room. | **"So you rely on agents or 3PLs to find it for you. But you never really get the best deal, because they can't get you *a* price, they just tell you the *lowest* price they got."**<br><br>**"And let's not even talk about them verifying the quality for you."** | `"Best price, friend"`<br>`NO TRANSPARENCY`<br>`QUALITY?` |


### **Part 3: The New Game (55-90s)**

| Time (s) | Visual (What We See) | Narration (What We Hear) | On-Screen Text (Keywords) |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 55-65 | **The frustrating music cuts. A clean, hopeful electronic track begins.**<br>The screen wipes to the clean, dark-mode UI of the **RealSourcing platform**. The logo animates in smoothly.<br>The UI shows a curated list of factories, each with a clear **FGPI score** and **capability tags** (`Dropshipping Friendly`, `Low MOQ`). | (The narrator's tone becomes clear, confident, and direct)<br><br>**"But... all of that is over."**<br><br>**"We built RealSourcing to make sourcing and fulfillment simple again."** | (Text animates in)<br>**It's Over.** |
| 65-75 | **The visuals directly address the viewer's skepticism.**<br>The screen shows the RealSourcing logo, then a big red "X" crosses it out, and the words `ANOTHER AGENT` appear, also crossed out.<br>The screen then transitions to a simulated RealSourcing **Webinar**. A real factory owner is on screen, live from their factory floor, answering questions from buyers in a chat window. | **"And don't worry, I know what you're thinking. We are NOT another agent or 3PL."**<br><br>**"We provide a real platform for sourcing and negotiation. We organize the meetings..."** | `NOT an Agent`<br>`NOT a 3PL`<br>`REAL NEGOTIATION` |
| 75-85 | **The visuals show the core value proposition.**<br>1. The UI shows a negotiation dashboard where a buyer is getting tiered pricing based on volume, directly from the factory.<br>2. A shot of a factory that is young, modern, and clearly geared towards e-commerce (small, automated production lines). The factory has a high **"Growth Partner"** score on their RealSourcing profile.<br>3. The screen highlights key terms on a factory's profile: `NO MOQ`, `ZERO DEPOSIT for first 100 orders`. | **"...we help you get the lowest possible price, and we help you find your early-stage supply chain partners."**<br><br>**"New-model factories that are willing to grow with your dropshipping business. No frustrating MOQs, no scary deposits. Everything is negotiable."** | `TRUE PARTNERS`<br>`GROW TOGETHER`<br>`EVERYTHING IS NEGOTIABLE` |
| 85-90 | **The final call to action.**<br>The screen fades to black, showing only the RealSourcing logo and a simple, clean URL.<br>`realsourcing.com` | (Music swells to a confident, final chord)<br><br>**"Stop being a part-time sourcing agent. Start building your empire."** | **RealSourcing**<br>`Stop sourcing. Start building.` |
