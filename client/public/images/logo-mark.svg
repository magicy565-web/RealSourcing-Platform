  <!--
    Faithful reconstruction of the "RS" geometric monogram from concept-A.
    The mark consists of:
    1. A square outline frame (rotated 45° = diamond, but here kept as square with sharp corners)
    2. Inside: an R-like shape (two diagonal lines from top-left meeting at center, then a curved S-like lower half)

    Looking carefully at the image:
    - Outer shape: a square with sharp top-right and bottom-left corners, slight inward curves on top-left and bottom-right
    - Inner shape: overlapping R and S letterforms rendered as geometric strokes
    - The top portion looks like a triangular/diamond R (two lines going from top-left corner to center-right)
    - The bottom portion is a curved S shape
    - All strokes use a purple-to-lavender gradient
    - The outer frame is a square rotated slightly, or a square with cut corners
